   - **Researcher**: username: `researcher`, password: `research123`, role: `researcher`
   - **Engineer**: username: `engineer`, password: `engineer123`, role: `engineer`

### Step 2: Explore the Dashboard
After login, you'll see the main dashboard with:
- **Statistics Cards**: Total components, quantities, alerts
- **Charts**: Monthly inward/outward trends
- **Alert Panels**: Low stock and old stock notifications
- **Recent Activity**: Latest inventory movements

### Step 3: Component Management
1. Click "Components" in the navigation
2. Explore the pre-loaded sample components including:
   - Resistors (10kŒ©)
   - Capacitors (10nF Ceramic)
   - Microcontrollers (ARM Cortex-M4)
   - Sensors (Temperature)
   - Memory (EEPROM)

### Step 4: Add a New Component
1. Click "Add Component" button
2. Fill in component details:
   ```
   Name: LED Red 5mm
   Part Number: LED-RED-5MM-TH
   Manufacturer: Generic
   Category: Semiconductors
   Quantity: 100
   Location: A1-B3
   Unit Price: 12
   Critical Low Threshold: 10
   Description: 5mm Through-hole Red LED, 2V forward voltage
   ```
3. Save the component

### Step 5: Perform Stock Operations

#### Inward Operation (Adding Stock)
1. Click "Inward Stock" button
2. Select a component (e.g., "Resistor 10kŒ©")
3. Enter quantity: `50`
4. Reason: `Stock replenishment`
5. Project: `General Stock`
6. Submit to add stock

#### Outward Operation (Removing Stock)
1. Click "Outward Stock" button
2. Select a component
3. Enter quantity to remove
4. Reason: `Circuit prototyping`
5. Project: `Project Alpha`
6. Submit to remove stock

### Step 6: Search and Filter
1. Use the search bar to find components by name or part number
2. Filter by:
   - **Category**: Select "Passive Components"
   - **Stock Status**: Choose "Low Stock" to see alerts
   - **Quantity Range**: Set min/max values
3. Clear filters to reset view

### Step 7: View Component Details
1. Click the eye icon (üëÅÔ∏è) next to any component
2. Review detailed information including:
   - Complete specifications
   - Stock status and location
   - Movement history
   - Value calculations

### Step 8: Notifications System
1. Notice automatic notifications for:
   - Low stock items (below threshold)
   - Old stock items (3+ months without movement)
2. Notifications appear in the dashboard and as pop-ups

### Step 9: Admin Features (Admin Login Only)
1. Login as admin to access:
   - User management
   - System-wide settings
   - Delete components
   - Full permission control

### Step 10: Test Responsive Design
1. **Desktop**: Full feature experience
2. **Tablet**: 
   - Resize browser to ~768px width
   - Notice navigation changes
   - Touch-friendly interface
3. **Mobile**:
   - Resize to ~375px width
   - Collapsible navigation menu
   - Stacked layouts
   - Scrollable tables

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Low Stock Alert
1. Find a component with low quantity (e.g., "Resistor 10kŒ©" - 25 units)
2. Perform outward operation to reduce below threshold
3. Observe automatic low stock notification

### Scenario 2: Bulk Operations
1. Import components via CSV (use Export first to see format)
2. Export current inventory to CSV file
3. Verify data integrity

### Scenario 3: User Role Testing
1. Login with different roles
2. Notice permission differences:
   - Researchers can only view/search
   - Engineers can perform outward operations
   - Users can perform all operations except user management
   - Admins have full access

### Scenario 4: Movement Tracking
1. Add stock to a component
2. Remove stock from the same component
3. View component details to see movement history
4. Verify user, date, reason, and project tracking
